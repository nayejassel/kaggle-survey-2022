# kaggle-survey-2022
As a person who is getting into the field of data science, I am interested in learning about the different tools and skills required for this type of profession, as well as being able to observe a general state of the industry. This 2022 survey organized by the Kaggle team, compiles several questions with this thematic and gives us the opportunity to perform an analysis to describe the different profiles we can find in Data Science and Machine Learning.

According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey in 2021, it is evident that the adoption of AI is steadily increasing and the advantages it offers are still substantial. A significant number of participants in the survey reported that their organizations have implemented AI capabilities, as they witness its positive influence on their financial performance. The goal of this notebook is to extract insights from the responses of 2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science (DS/ML) Survey about the state of DS/ML in the industry in 2022 as well as about the profile DS/ML landscape in the market.
